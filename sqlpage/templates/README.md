# SQLPage component templates

SQLPage templates are handlebars[^1] files that are used to render the results of SQL queries.

## Default components

SQLPage comes with a set of default[^2] components that you can use without having to write any code.
These are documented on https://sql.ophir.dev/components.sql

## Custom components

You can write your own component templates and place them in the `sqlpage/templates` directory.
To override a default component, create a file with the same name as the default component.
If you want to start from an existing component, you can copy it from the `sqlpage/templates` directory
in the SQLPage source code[^2].
